A Minecraft Tool-Assisted-Speedrun mod originally made by tr7zw and modified by ScribbleLP

I apologize in advance for nooby implementations and awful mistakes, since this is literally the first time I ever tried to do something with java... but hey it works...

This mod records your inputs and is able to play them back, similar to videos on this site http://tasvideos.org/

An early example can be seen here https://youtu.be/qbCoTa5p52w or here https://youtu.be/AYlqu3ExpnQ

Have a nice day with this!
